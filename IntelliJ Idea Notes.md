# IntelliJ Idea Notes

##Core IDE tools
* Help gives all shortcuts
* Double shift to search all
* Save file as scratch file for notes etc.  Can then search for scratches and delete them later.
* Preferences, increase decrease font size can bind to mouse wheel.
* Search intellij plugins for markdown source, eg markdown navigator.
* Preferences - project structure to set up module dependencies i.e libs needed in project.
* Can set up an artifact so that the project builds a .jar file.  Can also set up run cofiguration to run from the .jar file. 
* Can analyse code from the menu.

##Code navigation and generation
* DOUBLE SHIFT to search everywhere. V.useful. Also for commands, eg open terminal.Build project.
* Ctl + N for going to class directly.
* Ctl + E for open recent files and windows.  V.useful.
* Ctl + B to find parent method etc... when clicking on method.
* Ctl + shift + l for peek definition of class.
* Ctl F12 shows members within measuring tape.
â€¢ Alt + F1 to open a class within a particular project window.
* Ctl+H to see class hierarchy.
* There is a shortcut key for constructor generation,
* Ctl + alt + T  to get surround code, e.g for loop, do loop, try catch etc..

## Code Inspections and Intentions
* Code inspections are code analysis rules.
* Ctl + s for code inspection.
* Alt + enter to show all intention suggestions.
* Ctl + shift + a  to type in suggestions.  Can type in 'inspect code' to inspect all code.
* Alt + enter also for suggestions.
* Note suggestions and intentions very similar.

##  Refactoring
* Ctl + shift + alt + t  for refactoring options.
* If method has 4 or more params, then sensible to extract as param list. Ide does this all for you.
* Can move methods to a different class.
* Can extract interfaces.
* Can replace constructor with a factory method, create measuring tape rather than measuringtape constructor.
* Can safely decouple using delegation rather than inheritance in refactoring methods.

## IntelliJ live templates
* Boiler plate code out of the box.
* They are contextually aware.
* Fori tab gives for loop.
* Ctl + J for list of live templates.
* Sout for println
* Psvm  for main method
* Psf for public static final method
* Highlight code , ctl + alt + t to give refactoring, surround with try catch for example.
* Can create your own live templates within the ide, eg public method with variables etc...
